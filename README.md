# CIFAR-10 Mini Project üñºÔ∏è

This is a simple image classification project using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Steps
1. Load CIFAR-10 dataset (10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).
2. Normalize images.
3. Build a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
4. Train on a subset of data for quick results.
5. Evaluate accuracy and visualize predictions.

## Results
- Achieved ~65-70% accuracy on small subset (can improve with full training).
- Example prediction: True = Dog üê∂, Predicted = Dog ‚úÖ
